This is a website/mobile app that makes it easier for people
to use their native language on Twitter.  It provides a menu
of common phrases that a user can select and use to compose a
tweet. Tweet2Learn is aimed especially at second-language learners
of their heritage language, to give them confidence in using a few
phrases in the language without worrying about spelling, complicated
keyboard input, and so on.  Start the conversation!

Tweet2Learn is being developed as part of the Indigenous Tweets project:

you can contact me by email:

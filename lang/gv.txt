Don't laugh at her.|Ny gear urree.
She doesn't say what she thinks.|Cha nel ee gra c'red t'ee smooinaghtyn.

I've forgotten the details of the fact you mention.|Ta mee er n'yarrood ny mynreddyn jeh'n irriney t'ou g'imraa.
That is where you are mistaken.|Ta shen raad t'ou jannoo marran.
How can you do that without my permission.| Kys vod oo jannoo eh shen fegooish my chied.
